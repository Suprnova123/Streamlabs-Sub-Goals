# Streamlabs Sub Goal
This is a simple template designed to be a sort of recreation of Streamlabs' default goal design. Specifically this is for sub goals, featuring support for automatically displaying your current subscribers on launch and updating when you receive a new subscriber.

## Important
Because of Twitch's API limitations, you are unable to fetch subscriber counts through the public API without authentication. See [AUTHENTICATION.md](https://github.com/Suprnova123/Streamlabs-Sub-Goal-Template/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information.
