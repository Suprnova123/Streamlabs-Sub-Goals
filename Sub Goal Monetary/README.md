# Monetary Sub Goal

This widget is identical to the Sub Points Goal, except the values are in a monetary value rather than in sub points. This code assumes that you receive the standard $2.50 for each tier 1 subscription, as most affiliates do. You can change this value by adjusting the multiplier at lines 9 and 27.

## Notice
Line 2 contains the text "\<streamer>", which needs to be replaced by your username. See [AUTHENTICATION.md](https://github.com/Suprnova123/Streamlabs-Sub-Goal-Template/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information.
